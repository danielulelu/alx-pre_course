Imagine we have to create a program that will store all the words contained in a file in an array. That file is passed as an argument to our program.
 There is no way we could know in advance how many words the file will contain. We can not declare a big array like char *words[1024]; and assume that there will never be more than 1024 words in the file.
 Thatâ€™s when malloc and friends come to the rescue, and will permit us to allocate dynamically the amount of memory we need.

The malloc function allocates a specific number of bytes in memory and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. This memory will have to read and write permissions.
